# Callan Syratt - Code Assignment
## Priorities
I had very limited time in order to complete the task, as such I took the following priorities.
- **Function over extendibility** <br>
I judged the scope of the project to be relatively small. Given my limited time, and the small project scope, I felt that the time taken to extend it's capability if scope increased would be negligible compared to the time spent trying to future proof it now.
- **Limited breadcrumbs** <br>
I've often found that if one was to break down/separate the code too much, it quickly becomes just as bad as if the entire application was written in one file. So I tried to keep things reasonable grouped together without being too cumbersome or confusing.


## Extensibility
Although I did prioritise functionality over extendibility, I did lend some mind to the changing of the deduction brackets. Having separated out static variables for each bracket (see Tax Calculator/Configurations/) the "manual" effort involved for the modification of brackets values has been kept to a minimal as each of the min/max values are located within the one file.

If the scope were to increase to include past/future years... I'll admit it will cost more to implement functionality for that, however I do not expect said scope to increase to that. I am a firm believer that trying to future proof for the unlikely quickly leads to wasted time and effort (thusly money)
